## How to create a database on application launch?
I see two options for this:
  1. Create a database programatically when the application launches => have the application do the work. The benefit is that for local development, I don't need any extra setup; I can just run a Postgres container with mostly default settings.
  2. Create a database by executing a psql command inside a StatefulSet manifest => have Kubernetes and Docker do the work. This feels like a more reasonable approach, since the application should really just operate inside it's own database. The downside is that I need a docker-compose setup for local development, since I need to setup the database in a specific way before the application can use it.

Maybe add `init.sql` as a ConfigMap?

## Running Postgres in a Docker container

1. Create a container called `db_pingpong` and set two environment variables.
2. Log in as db user `admin`.

```
docker run --name db_pingpong -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin -e POSTGRES_USER=admin -d postgres
docker exec -it db_pingpong psql -U admin
```

## Postgres commands

```
create database pingpong;
\c pingpong

create table pings (id integer PRIMARY KEY, timestamp timestamp NOT NULL);

insert into pings (id, timestamp) values (1, '2021-09-04 17:16:00');

select * from pings;

select count(*) from pings;
```
