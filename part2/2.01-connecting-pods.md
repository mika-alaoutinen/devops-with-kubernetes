## Troubleshooting

Enter a running pod with Shell:
> kubectl exec --stdin --tty main-app-dep-7b4695544c-czg4z -c main-app-reader -- /bin/sh

Try calling pingpong endpoint:
> wget -qO - http://pingpong-svc/pingpong => Response HTTP 500 Internal Server Error

---

## Solution

The actual problem was returning a response from GET /pingpong that was of type number (i.e. 1). Apparently Express interprets that as a HTTP status and not a message.

Changes to `main-app-reader` :
- Edit `/reader/hash` endpoint to query pingpong application rather than read file system. See `hash.ts`.

Changes to`pingpong`:
- Changed response to just a number, e.g. `1` or `2` rather than `pong 1` because I don't want to parse a response string.

Changes to `main-app`:
- Updated `deployment` yamls to deprecate shared volumes between main app reader and pingpong.
- Updated `pingpong-service.yaml` port to 80.
