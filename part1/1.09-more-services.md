Created a pingpong application and added a `deployment.yaml` for it.

To get `todo-backend` and `pingpong` working, I needed to add `deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml` for pingpong.

To run both applications at once, run apply in directories /pingpong and /todo-backend:
```
kubectl apply -f manifest
```
