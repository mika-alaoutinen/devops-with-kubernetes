## Without a load balancer
`service.yaml` in the `todo-frontend` project exposes a NodePort `30001`. This means that without a load balancer, port `30001` is open to the outside world from the pod. Hence, the application is available at `http://localhost:30001`.

## With a load balancer
Created a new cluster similarly to the material:
  - Local port `8081` maps into port `80` on the load balancer and
  - local port `8082` maps into port `30080` on agent 0.

Then, in `service.yaml`, NodePort is set to `30080`, which means that port `30080` is available to the outside world. Thus, the application is available at `http://localhost:8082`.
