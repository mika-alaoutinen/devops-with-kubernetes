To run both `todo-backend` and `todo-frontend` in their own pods, run the below command in folder `/devops-with-kubernetes/todo-app`.

```
kubectl apply -f manifests/ --recursive
```

Todo-frontend simply has an `img` element with `src="http://localhost:8081/api/image"`. This queries `todo-backend`, which fetches a random image and caches it.

I don't know why `src="http://todo-backend-svc/api/image"` didn't work. Hitting the url with

```
kubectl exec -it todo-frontend-dep-746598c789-l7khq -- wget -qO - http://todo-backend-svc/api/image
kubectl exec -it busybox1 -- wget -qO - http://todo-backend-svc/api/image
```

seemed to return an image, which suggests that `todo-frontend`'s service exposes that URL correctly. Yet the URL could not be resolved when it was given as the image's source.
