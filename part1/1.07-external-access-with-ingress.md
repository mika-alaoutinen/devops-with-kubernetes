Added an Ingress and a Service for `todo-backend`. Now the root endpoint of todo-backend is accessible from `http://localhost:8081/`.

The flow of network calls goes like so (I think):

Local port `8081`
-> Load balancer port `80`
-> ingress port `80`
-> service port `2345`
-> target port `3000`, i.e. the frontend application port.
