## Test NATS locally with Docker

```
docker pull nats
docker run -d --name nats-main -p 4222:4222 nats
docker logs -f nats-main
```

Note: enable NATS debug and trace logs with flags `nats -DV`

## Run setup in Kubernetes

1. Install NATS to cluster

```
helm install -n todo nats nats/nats
```

2. Add deployment and config map for `todo-broadcaster`.
3. Add deployment and service for `echo service`.
4. Update `todo-backend`'s `rollout.yaml` to include NATS URL.

## Doesn't work
When broadcaster has multiple replicas, messages sent to NATS get repeated. I guess I would need to maintain a list of messages that have already been sent and check that before sending a new message. Not going to spend any more time with this, though.
