## Readiness check endpoints

Added `/monitoring/readiness` endpoints to `pingpong` and `main-app-reader`. The readiness check respond with status 200 or 500 and the following payloads:

```
{ status: UP }
{ status: DOWN }
```

It's noteworthy that `main-app-reader`'s readiness check calls `pingpong`'s readiness check.

## Readiness probes to deployments

Adding the readinessProbe definitions worked fine. No real problems encountered.
