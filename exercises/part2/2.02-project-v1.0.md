Using ingress routing means that the frontend should call the "real" URL of the backend application. In my case, the backend is served at `http://localhost:8081/api/`. In comparison, a cluster-internal URL would be `http://todo-backend-svc/api/`.

The use ingress routing, both applications have `service` resources and a shared `ingress`. Note that the port exposed in the `services` is NOT 80, but 1234!
